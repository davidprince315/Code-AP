goal to build an web app that can take an audio recorded or already given and adjust the audio to make the tone deeper or higher 



Tasks to complete for app
- create ui/ learn more basic html
- code function to record and store audio in a file
- code function to playback audio
-code function to augment audio 


Code Questions 

- What does importing "send_file" from flask libary do?? allows for the app to Send the contents of a file to the client.
- what does it mean by storing audion files in dir??? Litterally storing the audio files in a seperate dir like how html files are stored in templates
- can i use the return function twice in python????? nigga no the the functionality will only go up to the first return statement 
- what does importing os do?? allows the program to get functions that interact with the operating system
- how does "debug" variable work?





Debugging Issus to solve
